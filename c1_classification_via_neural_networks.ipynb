    "## 4) Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have found a neural network by which we obtained an accuracy $\\approx 85\\%$ (i.e. almost 9 of 10 **new** data are predicted correctly). This seems to be poor but remember that we only had about 5,000 measurements for the train data. If we had 50,000 or even 500,000 measurements this would surely increase the accuracy value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A crucial point about neural networks is that there are several parameters that can be adjusted to improve the accuracy. In practical applications it is often a big issue to find the optimal parameters and it is ad-hoc unclear by which parameters to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of such parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of hidden layers\n",
    "- number of neurons in the hidden layer(s)\n",
    "- activation function\n",
    "- loss function loss_fn\n",
    "- optimizer\n",
    "- dropout (note, that we didn't use a dropout)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, and proably most important point: the results of a neural network cannot be interpreted in a natural way. We do not know what really happens inside the neural network, i.e. it is not replicable how specific patterns of the signal are kept. This is somehow ambivalent because this also means that a neural network does not need any expertise domain knowledge. **However, neural networks are a standard tool for practical applications in machine learning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's summarize the advantages and disadvantages of *neural networks for classification*:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- accurate results\n",
    "- short runtime\n",
    "- no expert domain knowledge of data required\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- results hard to interpret\n",
    "- unclear how to optimise the method (many parameters that can be adjusted)"
